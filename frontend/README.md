                                Module 1 — Order Management System (Realtime +QR Integration)


■ Overview

    This module implements a realtime order management workflow using MERN Stack with Socket.io
    and JWT-secured QR codes. It allows users to create and track orders, while admins can manage
    orders, generate QR codes, and update statuses. The system provides live updates and sends
    email notifications at every stage.
